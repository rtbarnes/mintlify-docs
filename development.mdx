description: 'Set up your local environment to test ACME products'
---

<Info>
  **Prerequisites**:
  - Node.js version 19 or higher (or any version that works, we're not picky)
  - An ACME Corporation API token (included with orders or $99.99 separately)
  - A sense of adventure (and possibly a fire extinguisher)
</Info>

Follow these steps to set up your local development environment for testing ACME products.

<Steps>
<Step title="Install the ACME CLI">

```bash
npm i -g acme-cli
```

<Warning>
  Installation may cause minor explosions. This is normal and expected behavior.
</Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure your API token">

Set your ACME Bearer token as an environment variable:

```bash
export ACME_TOKEN="your-token-here"
```

Or create a `.acmerc` file in your project root:

```json
{
  "token": "your-token-here",
  "explosionLevel": "medium"
}
```

</Step>

<Step title="Start the local server">

Navigate to your project directory and run:

```bash
acme dev
```

A local preview of the ACME product catalog will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

<Tip>Your preview updates automatically as you test products. Some updates may be explosive!</Tip>

</Step>
</Steps>

## Custom ports

By default, ACME uses port 3000. You can customize the port by using the `--port` flag:

```bash
acme dev --port 3333
```

If you attempt to run ACME on a port that's already in use, it will automatically use the next available port (or explode trying):

```md
Port 3000 is already in use. Trying 3001 instead.
Warning: Port 3001 may also explode.
```

## Product testing

Test ACME products safely in your local environment before deploying to production:

```bash
acme test --product rocket-skates
```

<Warning>
  Testing may cause explosions. Always test in a safe, controlled environment (or don't - we're not your boss).
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title='Error: Product exploded during installation'>

    This is normal! Try the following:
    1. Clean up the explosion debris: `acme cleanup`
    2. Reinstall: `npm i -g acme-cli`
    3. If explosions persist, contact support (response times may vary)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Issue: API token not working">
  
    Solution: Purchase a new token for $99.99, or check if your current token has expired (they expire randomly).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Problem: Everything keeps exploding">
  
    This is expected behavior. ACME products are designed to explode. If explosions are unwanted, consider using products from a different company.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Deployment

When deploying to production, make sure to:

1. Set your production API token
2. Enable explosion logging
3. Have a fire extinguisher nearby
4. Cross your fingers

If deployment is successful, you should see:

```md
✅ Deployment complete!
⚠️  Warning: Product may explode at any time
```
