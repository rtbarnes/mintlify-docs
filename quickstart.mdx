## Get started in three steps

Order your first wacky ACME product and start causing chaos today!

### Step 1: Set up your account

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="user" title="Create your ACME account">
    To order our products, you'll need an ACME Corporation account. Sign up at our [customer portal](https://portal.acmecorp.com) - it's free and takes just seconds!
    
    <Warning>Account creation may cause minor explosions. This is normal.</Warning>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="key" title="Get your API token">
    Once you've created an account, you'll receive an ACME Bearer token. This token is included free with every order, or can be purchased separately for $99.99.
    
    <Tip>Keep your token secure! Lost tokens cannot be recovered, but new ones can be purchased at any time.</Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 2: Browse and order

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="shopping-cart" title="Explore our catalog">
    Check out our [Popular Products](/services/popular-products) page to see our best-selling wacky inventions!
    
    From rocket-powered roller skates to explosive bird seed, we've got everything you need for maximum chaos.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="credit-card" title="Place your order">

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 3: Receive and enjoy!

<Accordion icon="package" title="Your product arrives">
  1. Your ACME product will arrive via rocket-powered delivery (or standard mail, depending on availability).
  2. Unbox carefully - some products may have already exploded in transit!
  3. Follow the included instructions (or don't - we're not your boss).
  4. Enjoy your wacky new product!

  <Warning>All sales are final. No refunds for products that have already exploded.</Warning>
</Accordion>
