## Authentication

All API endpoints require an ACME Bearer token. Tokens can be obtained by purchasing any ACME product (tokens included free with every order, or sold separately for $99.99).

```json
"security": [
  {
    "bearerAuth": []
  }
]
```

<Warning>
  Keep your tokens secure! Lost tokens cannot be recovered, but new ones can be purchased at any time.
</Warning>
